After earning fame and fortune in the United Kingdom, James Corden enjoyed more widespread, international fame after becoming the host for The Late Late Show in March 2015. He hosted the show until May 2023. Outside of The Late Late Show, James Corden has displayed notable flexibility as an actor, excelling in a range of both theatrical, film, and television roles.</p><p>In 2018, Corden's production company, Fulwell 73, produced the television series Seatbelt Psychic for Lifetime.</p><h2 id=salary><strong>Salary</strong></h2><p>James Corden's annual salary for his late show was $9 million. He reportedly walked away from a <a href=#>$50 million contract</a> to continue hosting the show for CBS.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>James Corden was born on the 22nd of August in 1978. Although he was born in Hillingdon, London, Corden grew up in the village of Hazelmere. His mother was a social worker, and his father was a musician who later sold bibles. James Corden's artistic talents were soon recognized, and by the age of 18 he was booking one-liners in movies like Martin Guerre. In his early 20s, Corden explored opportunities as a TV reporter while appearing in television series such as Boyz Unlimited, Teachers, Hollyoaks, Little Britain, and more. As Corden started to become more established in the acting world, he booked high-profile commercials. As the industry began to take him more seriously, Corden booked roles in movies like Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?, All or Nothing, Heartlands, and Cruise of the Gods.</p><h2 id=mainstream-success><strong>Mainstream Success</strong></h2><p>Although Corden was steadily pursuing an impressive acting career, he only truly began to rise to prominence in the 2000s. The show Fat Friends represented a major step forward for him, and his role won him a nomination for a Royal Television Society Award. 2004's stage production of The History Boys also helped bolster Corden's reputation, and this theater role led to an appearance in the film adaptation of the play.</p><p>James Corden took his career into his own hands when he co-wrote and co-starred in his own original series, Gavin & Stacey. The sitcom was a massive success with high ratings from critics. Corden was nominated once again for awards, but this time he won them. The actor was awarded a BAFTA for Best Male Comedy Performer and won a similar award during the British Comedy Awards. The show itself won numerous awards throughout its run. In 2010, Gavin & Stacey came to an end.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165690 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/James-Corden.jpg alt="James Corden Net Worth" width=594 height=377 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-165690 class=wp-caption-text>Chris Weeks/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career-after-gavin-amp-stacey><strong>Career After Gavin & Stacey</strong></h2><p>Prior to 2010, James Corden had been unable to capitalize on his newfound fame in work outside of Gavin & Stacey. Although the actor attempted to branch out and try new things while the show was running, most of these endeavors were poorly received and altogether unsuccessful. After Gavin & Stacey came to an end, James Corden was able to focus more on other projects, and these were more substantial.</p><p>James Corden blended comedy and sports journalism in the show A League of Their Own. The series focused on British football. James Corden has collaborated with the English national soccer team in a number of skits. Doctor Who fans will remember his role as Craig Owens in a number of episodes. In 2010, he landed a lead role in the film Gulliver's Travels. In 2011, he locked down another role in a major film â€“ this time in The Three Muskateers. In the same year, James Corden booked the leading role in a hit play called One Man, Two Guvnors. The play was incredibly well-received by critics and was undoubtedly one of the highlights of Corden's career.</p><p>More recent films include Ocean's 8, The Prom, and Cinderella in addition to lending his voice to Trolls, The Emoji Movie, Smallfoot, Superintelligence, and Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. Corden has appeared on the comedy game show Game On! and played the role of Jamie and executive produced Mammals.</p><h2 id=late-late-show><strong>The Late Late Show</strong></h2><p>Corden became better acquainted with an international audience after becoming the new host of The Late Late Show, replacing <a href=# title="Craig Ferguson Net Worth">Craig Ferguson</a>. The actor's role as host has earned him multiple Emmy nominations and widespread media praise. Although it was reported that Corden had become unsatisfied with the "daily grind" of being a talk show host, he extended his contract in 2019. The actor's contract allegedly included a salary worth somewhere between $4 and $5 million. He was earning around $9 million per year from his various endeavors.</p><p>In April 2022, Corden announced he would be walking away from The Late Late Show in 2023.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295653 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/James-Corden-1.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295653 class=wp-caption-text>Theo Wargo/Getty Images</p><h2 id=carpool-karaoke><strong>Carpool Karaoke</strong></h2><p>James Corden has been involved in a series called Carpool Karaoke since 2011, although it originally began as a comedy sketch related to Gavin & Stacey. The series involves Corden and celebrity musicians playing karaoke while driving a car in traffic. After becoming the host of The Late Late Show, Corden resurrected the skit and used it as a recurring segment. One of the most popular iterations of Carpool Karaoke featured the singer <a href=# title="Adele Net Worth">Adele</a>. As of 2020, the segment has over 200 million views on YouTube.

Corden is credited as the creator of the adaptation, and he also serves as the executive producer. Unlike the segment of The Late Late Show, Apple's Carpool Karaoke features a different host for each episode â€“ although the premise is identical.</p><p>James Corden faced some controversy when certain information was revealed about Carpool Karaoke. Behind-the-scenes images exposed the fact that Corden doesn't actually drive the car when filming the segment, even though he pretends to during the scenes. Corden also doesn't carpool to work in real life, and there are no carpool lanes on the roads where the segment is filmed. Corden later explained that due to safety concerns, he is unable to drive the car for the entirety of the segment, and the car was towed through the majority of the show.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>James Corden has been married to Julia Carey since 2012. The pair met through their mutual friend; fellow actor <a href=# title="Dominic Cooper Net Worth">Dominic Cooper</a>. In 2011 the couple had their first child and son. They also have two daughters, born in 2014 and 2017.

The seller was "Modern Family" creator <a href=#>Steve Levitan</a>. James and his wife listed this home for sale in February 2022 for $22 million. He ultimately sold this home in May 2023 for $17 million.</p><p>Corden also maintains a home in Belsize Park, London, and Templecombe House at Wargrave in Berkshire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLeiucSsZJynopmyr3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=James%20Corden%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=James%20Corden%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=James%20Corden%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=James%20Corden%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-corden-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=James%20Corden%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-12-best-chandler-bing-quotes-from-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 12 best Chandler Bing quotes from Friends">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./william-kellogg-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="William Kellogg Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
