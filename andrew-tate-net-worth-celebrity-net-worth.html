According to a 2023 indictment on rape and human trafficking charges, authorities in Romania believe Andrew Tate's <a href=#>net worth is in the range of $12 million</a>. In an official indictment statement, Romanian authorities claimed Andrew's $12 million net worth included 15 luxury cars, 14 luxury watches, 4 companies and 21 Bitcoin (worth $588,000 at the time of the statement). An August 2023 BBC report revealed that chat logs showed that in August 2022 "Tate's War Room" had 434 members paying $8,000 a year for their memberships. If accurate, that would equate to around $3.5 million in annual subscription fees.</p><p>After a moderately successful kickboxing career, Andrew launched a career as a media personality. Tate was a contestant on the 17th season of the British version of Big Brother before being removed due to a controversial video of him allegedly hitting a girl with a belt.</p><p>Today he is known for operating controversial social media accounts that promote a misogynist lifestyle. Many of his social media accounts have been banned. On June 20, 2023 Andrew and his brother <a href=#>Tristan Tate</a> were indicted on charges of rape and human trafficking by authorities in Romania. The indictment follows the brothers' arrest in December.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Emory Andrew Tate&nbsp; III was born in Chicago, Illinois in December 1986. His mother Eileen is a white British woman. His late father, Emory Tate II, was a black American who was an international chess master. In addition to Andrew, Emory and Eileen had two other children including a younger son named Tristan.</p><p>The family lived in Illinois and Indiana until Eileen and Emory subsequently divorced. After their divorce, Eileen and the children moved to England.</p><h2 id=fighting-career><strong>Fighting Career</strong></h2><p>In 2005, at the age of 19, Andrew began kickboxing professionally a cruiserweight out of his mother's hometown of Luton, England. By late 2008 he was ranked as one of the top 10 kickboxers in Britain by the International Sport Kickboxing Association (ISKA).</p><p>In 2009 Andrew Tate won the ISKA English Full-Contact Cruiserweight Championship and the IKF British Cruiserweight Championship. In 2011 he was the ISKA World Full-Contact Light Heavyweight Champion and in 2012 he was the Enfusion: Trial of the Gladiators Tournament Runner-Up. Tate was the ISKA World Full-Contact Light Cruiserweight Champion in 2013 and the Enfusion Live World Champion in 2014.</p><p>In 2010 he had his only professional MMA match.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-331924 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/andrew-tate2.jpg alt width=769 height=508 sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-331924 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage)</p><h2 id=big-brother><strong>Big Brother</strong></h2><p>In 2016 Andrew joined the cast of the British reality TV show "Big Brother." He was a cast member on the show's 17th season. His stint on the show did not last long. Almost immediately after the show began airing, old Tweets that were perceived as racist were highlighted on social media. After just six days on the show Andrew was removed from the cast after a video was released that allegedly showed him beating a woman with a belt. The woman would later confirm that the actions in the video were consensual.</p><h2 id=hustler8217s-university><strong>Hustler's University</strong></h2><p>In recent years Andrew has fashioned himself as an extremely masculine, misogynist, men's self-help guru. He operates an online subscription business called "Hustler's University" which gives men advice on how to treat women and be more manly.</p><p>Videos from Hustler's University's social media posts became extremely viral on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Hustler's University reportedly has over 100,000 subscribers paying $49.99 per month. If that subscriber number is accurate, that would equate to around $5 million in monthly revenue for the business.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342938 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/andrew-tate.jpg alt="Andrew Tate Net Worth" width=900 height=565 sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342938 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP via Getty Images)</p><p>Andrew Tate's fame peaked in late 2022 when some of world's largest social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook YouTube and TikTok banned Tate from their respective platforms. His Twitter account had been banned the previous year but was actually restored in November 2022 after the platform was acquired by <a href=#>Elon Musk</a>.</p><h2 id=greta-thunberg-interaction><strong>Greta Thunberg Interaction</strong></h2><p>In December 2022 Andrew sent a tweet at environmental activist <a href=#>Greta Thunberg</a> that ended up being widely mocked. In his tweet, Andrew said:</p><p><strong>Hello </strong><strong>@GretaThunberg</strong></p><p><strong>I have 33 cars. </strong><strong>My Bugatti has a w16 8.0L quad turbo. </strong><strong>My TWO Ferrari 812 competizione have 6.5L v12s. </strong><strong>This is just the start. </strong><strong>Please provide your email address so I can send a complete list of my car collection and their respective enormous emissions.</strong></p><p>Greta sent the following reply several hours later:</p><p><strong>yes, please do enlighten me. email me at <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=d6a5bbb7babab2bfb5bdb3b8b3a4b1af96b1b3a2b7babfb0b3f8b5b9bb>[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p><h2 id=webcam-business><strong>Webcam Business</strong></h2><p>According to their own account, Andrew and his younger brother Tristan have made millions of dollars operating a webcam business where men reportedly pay $4 a minute to speak with models. The models reportedly have extracted extremely large sums of money from some of the callers by telling sob stories about their lives.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342940 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/andrew-tate-seized-car.jpg alt="Andrew Tate car collection" width=900 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342940 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Daniel MIHAILESCU / AFP) (Photo by DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=car-collection><strong>Car Collection</strong></h2><p>As he implied in his Greta Thunberg tweet, Andrew Tate's car collection is apparently quite large and valuable. It is believed that his collection includes over 20 vehicles… perhaps more than 30 as Andrew implied. From social media posts, Andrew Tate's car collection is known to include the following vehicles:</p><ul><li>Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport – Purchased for $5.2 million</li><li>Two Ferrari 812 competiziones – estimated at $600,000 a piece</li><li>Aston Martin Valhalla – On order, not yet received, but apparently worth $800,000</li><li>Two Lamborghinis</li><li>Rolls Royce Wraith</li><li>McLaren 720s</li></ul><p>In January 2023, Romanian police seized Andrew's several cars from Andrew Tate's car collection. Police sized a McLaren 765LT, a Rolls Royce Wraith, a 2018 Ferrari 812 Superfast S, a 2019 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S, A Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, a BMW X4 coupe, a 2019 Aston Martin Vanquish S and a Mercedes GLS.</p><h2 id=arrest><strong>Arrest</strong></h2><p>On December 29, 2022, Andrew and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania on charges that allege human trafficking, rape and being a member of an organized crime group.</p><p>On June 20, 2023, Andrew and Tristan were indicted on charges of rape and human trafficking. In a statement released by Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism, the brothers and several co-defendants formed a criminal organization in 2021 to "commit the crime of human trafficking on the territory of Romania, but also in other countries, such as the United States of America and Great Britain…." and that they misled seven alleged victims with "the intention to establish a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of real feelings of love."</p><p>The indictment further alleges that these women were forced through acts of violence and mental coercion to perform pornographic acts which were recorded and posted online.</p><p>The brothers deny all charges. On the day of their indictment they issued the following statement:</p><p>"<strong>While this news is undoubtedly predictable, we embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation… The indictment now allows us to present a comprehensive body of evidence, diligently collected and prepared over time, which will undoubtedly substantiate the brothers' claims of innocence.</strong>"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkuq6tjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI6apZ2qlax6ta3TnmSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Andrew%20Tate%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Andrew%20Tate%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Andrew%20Tate%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Andrew%20Tate%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandrew-tate-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Andrew%20Tate%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ariel-fibiger-car-accident-sheboygan-ariel-fibiger-obituary-ariel-fibiger-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariel Fibiger Car Accident Sheboygan, Ariel Fibiger Obituary, Ariel Fibiger Death">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-was-tupac-fired-from-menace-ii-society.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Was Tupac Fired From 'Menace II Society'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
