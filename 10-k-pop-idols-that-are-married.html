There are in fact <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K-pop</a></strong> idols that have tied the knot, despite the growing pressure from the industry to maintain singleness, or at least the aura of it. The large and ever-growing Hallyu wave is not without its faults, and has come under backlash for its continuous need to portray idols as single and available. Worse yet, many of these artists are warned to stay away from relationships, so they don’t run the risk of losing their fans. Some fans of the genre have been known to be intense sometimes, and have even resorted to online bullying whenever their favorite stars have entered into relationships.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=703 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Knowing how busy idol life is, many believe it is very hard to enter or maintain relationships, but the stars on this list have not only found success, but have gone even further to become husband and wife. One major issue facing many idols is their hectic work schedules, travel itineraries, and media and performance training, which keeps them on-the-go for most of the year. This is another factor that keeps the artists from entering into relationships, and sometimes when they do, it is with a fellow idol. In cases of the latter, many view it as a publicity stunt, so as to unite two fandoms together which will result in more streams, and the skyrocketing sales of tour tickets and merchandise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>However, despite all these, some idol relationships continue to flourish, and some have even started families of their own!
