He is a football commentator for Fox NFL Sunday and co-host of ABC’s Good Morning America.</p><p>In addition to his appearances in films like <a href=# rel=noopener>Magic Mike XXL</a>, Ice Age: Collision Course, and Charlie’s Angels, he is also well-known.</p><h2>Michael Strahan Early Life</h2><p>Strahan is a native of Houston. The youngest of six children, he is the son of basketball coach Louise (Traylor) Strahan and former Army Major Gene Willie Strahan, who had a 1–1 record against future heavyweight Ken Norton.</p><p>He is the nephew of former NFL defensive lineman Art Strahan, who is now retired. Strahan’s family relocated to BFV (Benjamin Franklin Village) in Mannheim, West Germany, when he was 9 years old.</p><p>Strahan did not begin playing high school football at Westbury High School until his senior year. Still, he did play organized football at Mannheim American High School (MAHS), a US Department of Defense-dependent high school in Kafertal (Mannheim) in 1985, where he was a linebacker for the Mannheim Bison.</p><p>Strahan’s father sent him to live with his uncle Art in Houston during the summer preceding his senior year at Westbury High School.</p><p>One football season was sufficient for Strahan to receive a scholarship offer from Texas Southern University. Strahan received his degree from Texas Southern University in 1993 and then joined the National Football League.</p><h2>Is Michael Strahan dating anyone in 2022?</h2><p>According to speculations from 2022, Michael Strahan is dating his 20-years-younger girlfriend, Kayla Quick. When she met Strahan, she worked as a waitress and stripper in a pub in Port Charlotte.</p><p>In 2015, they were first seen together at a Super Bowl after-party. Michael and Kayla were sighted on the Caribbean island of St. Barts in 2016, after which her name began to appear in several web sources.</p><p>The pair appears to be fairly content and has maintained a reasonably quiet relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Michael-Strahan-Girlfriend.jpg><h2>He was engaged to Eddie Murphy’s ex-wife, Nicole Mitchell.</h2><p>In 2007, Strahan began dating former fashion model and reality personality Nicole Mitchell; the couple has nine children together. Mitchell was previously married to the actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, but Michael divorced his second wife, Jean Muggli, in 2006.</p><p>The engagement took place on May 22, 2009. The pair had a long-term romance for seven years until their unpleasant separation in 2014. However, it was established that their breakup resulted from a vast distance and demanding schedules.</p><h2>The second wife of Michael Strahan, Jean Muggli</h2><p>Michael Strahan met his second wife, Jean Muggli, in her Manhattan spa in 1996, and they began dating almost immediately. In 1999, after nearly three years of dating Jean Muggli, he wed her. On October 28, 2004, the couple was welcomed with twin daughters, Isabella and Sophia Strahan.</p><p>The couple was formerly married and loved their union for seven years. However, in 2006 the couple divorced.</p><p>The divorce deal cost Michael $15 million, plus $18,000 per month in child support. After selling Strahan’s mansion for $3.6 million, she walked away with a staggering $1,8 million.</p><h2>Michael Strahan Collge Career</h2><p>Strahan followed in his uncle Art’s footsteps by playing defensive end at Texas Southern University. Strahan was so dominant that he drew double teams, which TSU coaches termed “Strahan rules.”</p><p>Strahan had begun to establish himself as an NFL prospect by his junior year. Strahan was named to the All-America first team as a senior with the Texas Southern Tigers by The Poor Man’s Guide to the NFL Draft, The Sheridan Network, Edd Hayes Black College Sports Report, and the Associated Press. He tallied 68 tackles, a school-record 19 quarterback sacks, and 32 tackles for losses totaling 142 yards.</p><p>The Poor Man’s Guide and Edd Hayes Black College Sports Report also named him Division I-AA Defensive Player of the Year. In 1992, he was voted First Team All-Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and Player of the Year in the SWAC for the second straight year.</p><p>He has also been voted the best Black college defensive player. Strahan led the SWAC with 14.5 quarterback sacks as a junior in 1991. His career total of 41.5 sacks is a Texas Southern record. 2014 saw his induction into the Black College Football Hall of Fame.</p><h2>Michael’s first wife was Wanda Hutchins.</h2><p>In Germany in 1992, Michael Strahan wed Wanda Hutchins for the first time. Because they attended the same high school, he met his future bride when he was 14, and she was 12 years old.</p><p>After dating for nearly a year, they wed in January 1992, 10 weeks after the birth of their daughter. Later, Michael and his wife relocated to the United States, where they had two children: Tanita Strahan and Michael Strahan Jr. Following the birth of their second child, the couple’s marital deteriorated.</p><p><strong>Also check:</strong></p><h2>Michael Strahan is the father of four children.</h2><p>Michael Strahan’s first wife, Wanda Hutchins, is the mother of his two children. Tanita, his daughter, was born in November 1991, followed by Michael Anthony Strahan Jr. in November 1995.</p><p>In addition, he was gifted with twin daughters named Isabella and Sophia with his second wife, Jean Muggli, in October 2004. Isabella and Sophia frequently post stunning images of themselves from various areas across the globe on social media, making it difficult to distinguish between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dganxxhY6moJygkZq5br%2FTq5ihmZ5itKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html&text=Michael%20Strahan%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%20History%20and%20all%20other%20update&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%20History%20and%20all%20other%20update" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%20History%20and%20all%20other%20update" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%20History%20and%20all%20other%20update" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-strahan-girlfriend-dating-history-and-all-other-update.html&description=Michael%20Strahan%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%20History%20and%20all%20other%20update" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mike-vernon-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Vernon Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mackenzie-astin-age-young-movies-wife-net-worth-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MacKenzie Astin Age, Young, Movies, Wife, Net Worth, Instagram">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
