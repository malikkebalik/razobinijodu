But recently, it appears that she may have lost a sponsorship due to fan outrage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jenelle-Evans-8-1.jpg><h2>Jenelle Evans and David Eason lose custody of their children</h2><p id=par-2_38>People really began to get upset with Evans after she married David Eason. Eason commonly made homophobic remarks which eventually resulted in him getting kicked off of Teen Mom 2. Later, his actions had an even bigger consequence.</p><p id=par-3_51>When he shot the family dog in front of Evans’ kids, the kids were removed from their custody and fans berated the couple constantly on social media. Eventually, Eason had to admit to killing the dog. He said that he did it because the dog was aggressive towards his daughter, Ensley.</p><p id=par-4_19>“It was a situation where my daughter, her health, her safety was in danger,” Eason told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>People Now</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_65>“This was something that nobody wants to ever have to do. The dog was aggressive. Yes, she might not be huge or whatever, but you know when a dog bites a child on the face more than one time, then it should never be around the child again. If you give the dog up for adoption, one day it’s going to be around children again.”</p><h2>Jenelle Evans and David Eason break up</h2><p id=par-6_32>After losing custody of her children and getting kicked off of Teen Mom 2, Evans had finally had enough of Eason. She broke up with him and announced the split via Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_49>“I’ve mostly kept off social media the past few days because I’ve been focused on making some big life decisions,” she wrote. “I’ve lived my life on camera since I was 17 years old. And a lot of it hasn’t been pretty. But it’s been my life.”</p><p id=par-8_52>“I know I need to make changes. I’m starting that now,” she wrote. “The kids and I have moved away from David. Nobody gets into a marriage expecting it to end but I know that’s what is best for me, and for my kids. Today I’ve filed papers to start that process.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_25>But lately, Evans has been spending a lot of time with Eason, which has caused fans to wonder how serious she was about the breakup.</p><h2>Jenelle’s sponsorship</h2><p id=par-10_22>Evans recently posted a picture of her holding her daughter Ensley as an advertisement for Peanut, a social networking app for mothers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_76>“This is such a sentimental photo to me, it was taken when Ensley was born,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Evans wrote</a>. “Becoming a mother was really overwhelming for me. There were so many emotions going through my head, ‘Will I be a good mom? How will I do this?’ I was so scared and nervous. I know I needed support from other moms but I didn’t know where to turn to. If you can relate to this, you should join Peanut.”</p><p id=par-12_26>The post was soon deleted without much explanation as to why, but according to one Twitter user’s screenshot, it could have been because of customer backlash.</p><p id=par-13_23>“You will get a lot of [emails], DM’s and backlash over this,” the person <a href=#>DMed Peanut</a> on Twitter. “Research would have been better.”</p><p id=par-14_24>“Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention. We are dealing with it ASAP,” the representative responded. “The content has been removed.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBprHNZqSopV1nequxzZ6jpZ1dmsOiutJmpKKfmKl6qa3VnmSjraOpeq270q1kmmWjpbyvv86rqqGhoGKxtrGMraZmmZ5itq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYr2wv9Nnn62lnGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html&text=Jenelle%20Evans%20Might%20Have%20Just%20Lost%20a%20Sponsorship%20Due%20to%20an%20Instagram%20Post&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html&title=Jenelle%20Evans%20Might%20Have%20Just%20Lost%20a%20Sponsorship%20Due%20to%20an%20Instagram%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html&title=Jenelle%20Evans%20Might%20Have%20Just%20Lost%20a%20Sponsorship%20Due%20to%20an%20Instagram%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html&title=Jenelle%20Evans%20Might%20Have%20Just%20Lost%20a%20Sponsorship%20Due%20to%20an%20Instagram%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenelle-evans-might-have-just-lost-a-sponsorship-due-to-an-instagram-post.html&description=Jenelle%20Evans%20Might%20Have%20Just%20Lost%20a%20Sponsorship%20Due%20to%20an%20Instagram%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./las-vegas-teenager-17-years-old-beat-to-death-by-a-group.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Las Vegas teenager, 17 years old: beat to death by a group">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-haley-joel-osment-gay-sexuality-partner-and-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Haley Joel Osment Gay  Sexuality Partner And Dating History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
