If you’ll remember, he’s the one who’s been shilling stories to The Sun ever since he left Britney’s employment after working for her from February through May last year. At first, Fernando kept things pretty believable with claims that Brit <a href=#>walked around naked</a> in front of him, tried to tempt him into her bed, and refused to wear underwear in public, the latter of which was the “last straw” because Fernando got the blame for the fallout. These things weren’t exactly flattering to Britney, but they were plausible because (as we all recall far too clearly) Britney has shown herself to be quite fond of going pantless in front of the paparazzi.</p><p>Then, Fernando escalated the game by selling the story that Britney <a href=#>beat her sons with belts</a> and knowingly fed them foods to which they were allergic. When Fernando finally filed his lawsuit last September, he included the above allegations as well as the claim that Britney <a href=#>had sex in front of her kids</a>. According to Radar Online, Flores has now filed a new document with the court, which is rather comical in one light but also quite serious in its potential ramifications. Flores is asking for $10 million in damages due to the “psychological damage, anxiety attacks, depression and insomnia” that he suffered because Britney farted, picked her nose, and (here’s the kicker) took many drugs, including methamphetamines. Really.</p><p>Former cop Fernando Flores is suing the star’s conservators alleging sexual harassment against Spears. Flores alleges he faced a series of bizarre come-ons from Britney, 29, who paraded naked in front of him and often beckoned him into her bedroom for sex.</p><p>In recent filings of Flores’ lawsuit, a copy of which RadarOnline.com and Star magazine have exclusively obtained, the former bodyguard ratcheted up his charges against the Toxic singer, claiming she broke wind and picked her nose “unapologetically,” did not shower for days on end, nor brushed her teeth or ever wore deodorant.</p><p>“Spears was generally personally unkempt,” Flores, 29, alleged.</p><p>The ex-staffer — who is claiming at least $10 million damages from Britney for what he describes as “repeated, unwanted sexual advances and harassment” — detailed in court papers filed in Los Angeles how the chart-topping diva craved a cocktail of drugs during the time he worked for her.</p><p>“Based on his former experience as a police officer, Plaintiff (Flores) is informed and believes and alleged thereon that Defendant Spears was often under the influence of illegal prescription and non-prescription drugs, such as Ritalin, Narcon (Naloxone) and methamphetamines,” the documents state.</p><p>He claims, “Defendant Spears was mentally unstable, and personally obnoxious and demanding, requiring her staff on various occasions and for no rationally discernable reasons to address her as ‘Jennifer’ or ‘Queen Bee,’ on other occasions, Defendant Spears would cut her hair in an erratic fashion, leaving uneven and bald spots on her head.”</p><p>Flores worked for Spears from February until July, 2010, when he stormed out of her Calabasas, Calif., mansion after she allegedly bent over in a short nightie to expose herself.</p><p>“Spears made repeated unwanted sexual advances to Plaintiff, summoning (him) to her room at her residence for no other purpose or reason than to expose her naked or near naked body to Plaintiff,” according to the suit.</p><p>But Flores insists “the sexual advances of Spears were unwanted for a variety of reasons.”</p><p>“Spears had obnoxious personal habits, such as chain smoking cigarettes, which made her smell continually of stale tobacco,” he wrote in his court document.</p><p>“She broke wind or picked her nose unselfconsciously and unapologetically before Plaintiff (Flores) and others and she was constantly and gratuitously loud and profane in her speech.</p><p>“She did not bathe for days on end, did not use deodorant, did not brush her teeth, did not fix her hair, did not wear shoes or socks.”</p><p>According to Flores, he suffered psychological damage, anxiety attacks, depression and insomnia as a result of Britney’s alleged harassment.</p><p>Soon after the suit was filed, last year, the Spears family released a statement saying it was “just another unfortunate situation where someone is trying to take advantage of the Spears family and make a name for himself.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Radar Online</a>]</p><p>Britney’s camp has long since held the claim that Flores is attempting to pull a <a href=#>shakedown</a>, and her attorneys have filed a motion to strike the ex-bodyguard’s latest filing. Further, a Britney source has also responded <a href=#>to TMZ</a>: “He’s a liar.” Here’s the thing — this guy has progressively released statements about things that we can believe that Britney would do, such as the sexual overtures. Then, he made more serious allegations about her parenting, and now he’s coupling some bizarre complaints (the farting and nose picking) with the most potentially damaging allegation of all: those damn methamphetamines. Obviously, Flores’ logic all along has been to make many believable statements about Britney so that, in turn, we would ideally buy anything that he says about her. Yet I simply don’t think it’s possible for Britney to be a methhead when she’s been under such strict guidelines from her conservator father for the past several years. Yes, she’s not all there, mentally, but Flores is pulling a really dirty tactic here and, clearly, has crossed the line because he just wants that $10 million.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fp_7577964_spears_britney_bry_21_22.jpg alt=fp_7577964_spears_britney_bry_21_22 title=fp_7577964_spears_britney_bry_21_22 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fp_7577876_spears_britney_bry_13_22.jpg alt=fp_7577876_spears_britney_bry_13_22 title=fp_7577876_spears_britney_bry_13_22 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmam5pbIZxe8GroK2mla6stLzEmqmsl5WteqO7w7Kerpmimayurcqeqpiln6eyoK3LpZygmaSevK%2B%2Fvp%2BYq6yZo7Sgus6snJiomZi4qrrGmKSerJiUwrSxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20ex-minder%20makes%20more%20allegations%2c%20including%20farting%2c%20meth%20use&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20ex-minder%20makes%20more%20allegations%2c%20including%20farting%2c%20meth%20use" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20ex-minder%20makes%20more%20allegations%2c%20including%20farting%2c%20meth%20use" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20ex-minder%20makes%20more%20allegations%2c%20including%20farting%2c%20meth%20use" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-ex-minder-makes-more-allegations-including-farting-meth-use.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20ex-minder%20makes%20more%20allegations%2c%20including%20farting%2c%20meth%20use" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-meghan-mccain-make-more-money-than-ana-navarro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Meghan McCain Make More Money Than Ana Navarro?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ross-rachel-s-planetarium-song-wicked-game-from-friends-still-makes-us-feel-all-the-feels.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ross &amp;amp; Rachel's Planetarium Song &amp;quot;Wicked Game&amp;quot; From 'Friends' Still Makes Us Feel All The Feels">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
