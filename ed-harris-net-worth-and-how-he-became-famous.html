Here’s a look at Harris’ net worth, career, and how he became famous. &nbsp;</p><h2>Ed Harris’ movies and TV shows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ed-Harris-Westworld.jpg><p id=par-2_57>Harris started his acting career in theatre in 1973. About one year after he began his acting studies at the University of Oklahoma, one of the teachers asked him to audition for Camelot at a community theater, reports <a href=#>NPR</a>. After his audition, he landed the starring role King Arthur at the Jewel Box Theatre in Oklahoma.</p><p id=par-3_68>Harris made his television acting debut in a 1976 episode of the television series Gibbsville titled “Trapped.” The following year, he appeared in an episode of Delvecchio titled “Cancelled Contract.” Harris made his film debut in the 1978 film Coma, in which he played a pathology student.Harris rose to fame after appearing in the 1983 film The Right Stuff. He played the role of astronaut John Glenn.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Ed Harris didn’t feel good about ‘Westworld’ Season 3</h2><p id=par-4_48>Harris, who plays William on Westworld, isn’t thrilled with the way his character changed in season 3. During his interview with <a href=#>Vulture</a>, he admitted this “wasn’t the most joyous season for me.” He continued by saying playing the Man in White isn’t what he signed up for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Westworld-.jpg><p id=par-5_55>“You do what you gotta do,” said Harris. “I mean, I signed on to play the Man in Black. I didn’t sign on to play the Man in White. So it wasn’t the most joyous season for me, I gotta say. It’s not so hard to embody, but it’s hard to feel like something I’m really enjoying doing.”</p><h2>What convinced Ed Harris to become an actor</h2><p id=par-6_88>Harris says his role in Camelot back in 1973 sealed the deal for him. He told NPR he felt such a high that he knew this was the line of work for him. The actor also says he was so immersed in his character that he doesn’t even remember being in the play. Although he spent many years searching for that same high from another role, Harris doesn’t think he found it yet. Here’s how Harris describes that experience and the impact it still has on him:</p><p>I don’t remember doing the play at all. Really, I mean, seriously I don’t remember doing the play. I was just in another zone. I was in it. I had this feeling of complete ecstasy. It’s probably the most high I’ve been ever, in any way. It’s almost like you spend the rest of your life trying to get back to that state where you’re just present, doing it, no thought other than doing this character in this play or this film.</p><h2>Ed Harris’ net worth</h2><p id=par-7_18>As of this writing, Ed Harris has a net worth of $20 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates.</p><p id=par-8_10><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=#>Luke Hemsworth Net Worth and How He Became Famous</a></p><p id=par-9_5><strong>Read more</strong>: Follow Sheiresa <a href=#>@SheiresaNgo</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSypXnHmqmroaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYY7W1ucto</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html&text=Ed%20Harris%20Net%20Worth%20and%20How%20He%20Became%20Famous&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html&title=Ed%20Harris%20Net%20Worth%20and%20How%20He%20Became%20Famous" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html&title=Ed%20Harris%20Net%20Worth%20and%20How%20He%20Became%20Famous" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html&title=Ed%20Harris%20Net%20Worth%20and%20How%20He%20Became%20Famous" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-harris-net-worth-and-how-he-became-famous.html&description=Ed%20Harris%20Net%20Worth%20and%20How%20He%20Became%20Famous" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./have-any-of-the-brown-children-chosen-to-live-a-polygamist-lifestyle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Have Any of the Brown Children Chosen To Live a Polygamist Lifestyle?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ed-begley-jr-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed Begley Jr. Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
