Lee Chatfield has been accused of sexually assaulting his sister-in-law, Rebekah Chatfield. However, Lee Chatfield denies the accusations. He admitted over the statement that he was having an affair with his sister-in-law and appeared to be attracted towards her after the girl turned 18. It all started when she was underage.</p><p>Chatfield’s sister-in-law has filed a complaint against him with an assault of alleged sexual misbehavior. She said that it all started when she was a teenager and attending his church and the associated Christian school. She has now brought this matter to the notice of Lee’s wife, Stephanie Chatfield.</p><h3>Stephanie Zondervan Wiki</h3><p>As per the online records, she was born in the 1990s and she is living in her 30s. She is currently residing in Levering and also lived in Saint Ignas, Petoskey, Alanson, Pellston, and Dunbar as well. Andrew Scott Zondervan and Charlene Renee Zondervan are her parents while Samantha Zondervan is her sister.</p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Stephanie Zondervan Chatfield and Lee Chatfield were the high school sweethearts. They together have five children. Lee Chatfield was a former House speaker. Lee Chatfield became one of the youngest speakers in Michigan history in comparison to the last 100 years. He became the youngest personality on the board. Lee was first elected to serve for the 107th District in the Michigan House in November 2014. He was born to his parents named Rusty Chatfield who remained a church pastor. The site also reported that Lee and Stephnie were married before graduating from college. They had three children by the time they were still undergraduate and Chatfield became 26. He married his high school sweetheart Stephanie in 2008 and they together started living in Levering in Michigan. They recently have five children-four sons and a daughter.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf5c3ca8a33c6058d1f11bf2c370d2287><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Sandra Maas Biography</span></a><p>Stephanie Zondervan disclosed in 2016 that she was often threatened by an unnamed person who had the details of her abortion and said that he would announce the news in public, as reported by the sources. She said that it was an unnamed person, threatening and taking the information to the public. At that time, her husband was against abortion. She then revealed it in a post on Facebook, which has now been deleted. The post directly addressed the person who was threatening Stephanie to reveal the information in public.</p><h3>Accusations on Lee Chatfield</h3><p>Lee Chatfield has been accused of abusing the woman starting at the age of 15 including one scene at the wedding night. Lee Chatfield confessed his relationship or extramarital affair with his sister-in-law. He confessed that he was involved in the affair in his statement that came forward from the side of the attorney Mary Chartier. The statement also said that it was a relationship where sexual assaults were made on the woman who is now claiming to be raped. The affair lasted long for years when his sister-in-law was nearly 15 and thereby turned to be an adult. However, Mr. Chatfield deeply regrets the decision.</p><p>Although, he said that he never sexually assaulted her in any manner during their years-long relationship. And he would surely fight against these false litigations or claims. On the other hand, the attorney of the woman has claimed that the relationship began back in those years when she was merely 15 years old, which is itself a big crime. She also claimed that the man “manipulated” her throughout her visit to the Michigan church. The lawyer also accused Chatfield that he continued to assault the woman even on his wedding night when the lady became an adult. She is now 27 years old.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf5f0ad8b86247500faa60158df399f93><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Bianca Harris Biography</span></a><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Stephanie Zondervan Chatfield Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Stephanie Payge Zondervan</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1990s</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>30s</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Levering, Michigan.
