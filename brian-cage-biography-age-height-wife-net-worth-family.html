At Double or Nothing on May 23, 2020, Cage made his official All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut when he was revealed to be the mystery participant in the Casino Ladder Match. Tazz accompanied Cage to the ring in what appeared to be the role of a manager. Cage would win the match, which also made him the number one contender for the AEW World Championship..</p><p>During the November tapings of Impact Wrestling, Cage would invoke "Option C" a choice open only to the X Division Championship holder, where they surrender the title, in favour of receiving a title match for the Impact World Championship at Homecoming on January 6, 2019, where he lost to champion Johnny Impact.</p><p>During the Las Vegas tapings Cage announced that he was medically cleared to return to the ring at Bound for Glory where he would be facing new no1 Contender, Sami Callihan. As part of the buildup to the match, Callihan confronted Cage, interrupting his "first dance" in the Ring with Melissa after their On-Screen wedding earlier in the broadcast. Following a vile insult, Cage would start to attack Callihan whom attempted to strike Cage with a bottle he was holding, but <a href=#>Melissa Santos</a> instead took a direct Hit from Callihan. At the PPV Cage was able to retain his title, however on the October 25th 2019 tapings, Callihan Invoked a re-match clause, with the match held in a Steel Cage. Cage would lose the title by pin-fall following a Super Pile-Driver from the ropes. At Hard to Kill, Cage was challenging RVD. Cage was too injured to continue after RVD hit a Van Terminator with a chair against Cage’s face. When the officials stopped the match, RVD wanted to keep going, and Daga ran in to protect Cage. RVD attacked Daga, and it became a new match. After the pay-per-view, Cage revealed his Impact Wrestling contract had expired, ending his tenure with the company. Cage also revealed he would be taking time off from wrestling to undergo surgery for an injury.</p><p>On January 11, 2018, Cage re-signed with TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling. On the February 15 episode of Impact!, Cage made his in-ring debut against <a href=#>John Cruz</a> in a decisive victory. At Slammiversary XVI, Cage defeated Matt Sydal to win the Impact X Division Championship. On the July 26 episode of Impact!, Cage made his first successful title defense in a rematch against Sydal. Cage also successfully defended his title against Fénix on the August 30 episode of Impact!, and against Rich Swann on the October 18 episode of Impact!.</p><p>In 2016, Cage began dating <a href=#>Melissa Santos</a>, who worked for Lucha Underground as a ring announcer. On January 23, 2018, Santos gave birth to a girl, Skylar Faith Button. The couple married on July 12, 2019. The marriage was also honored during the August & September Impact Wrestling Broadcasts, with the show holding their own ceremony (chaired by Fr James Mitchell) following from Cage's on-screen proposal earlier in the tapings.</p><p>In May 2017, Cage started working for Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah. On July 27, Cage unsuccessfully challenged Katsuhiko Nakajima for the GHC Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>On February 27, 2015, Cage made his debut for the Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), pinning AAA Mega Champion El Patrón Alberto in a six-man tag team main event. On April 1, Cage defeated Alberto again with help from La Sociedad in a match that was originally scheduled to take place at Rey de Reyes. After the match, Cage demanded a shot at Alberto's title. The title match took place on June 14 at Verano de Escándalo, where Alberto was victorious via disqualification, afterwards demanding a steel cage Lucha de Apuestas with Cage. On August 9 at Triplemanía XXIII, Cage was defeated by Alberto in a Lucha de Apuestas and was afterwards, as per stipulation, forced to have his head shaved.</p><p>On October 5, 2014, it was reported that Cage had signed with Lucha Underground. He debuted under the ring name Cage at the October 18 tapings winning a 4-way Elimination Match against Aero Star, Argenis and Angélico which was broadcast on January 14, 2015. Though he started the night seemingly as a dominant face, by the end of the night he attacked Prince Puma, cementing his status as a dominant heel. On the January 28 broadcast Cage received a shot at Puma's Lucha Underground Championship, but lost by disqualification, laying out both Puma and his manager Konnan afterwards. Weeks later, Cage defeated Puma in a non-title match to earn himself another title opportunity. The title match took place on the March 25 episode in a street fight, which saw Puma retain his title against Cage. He then started a feud against The Mack and defeated him in a "Falls Count Anywhere Match" at Ultima Lucha. In Season 2 of Lucha underground, Cage turned face and set his sights on Johnny Mundo. Mundo tried to attack Cage after his victory over the debuting <a href=#>Joey Ryan</a> only for Cage to turn the tables and hit him with his Weapon X finisher on the 2/17 edition of Lucha Underground. The two subsequently faced each other a week later, with Mundo winning after a distraction from the debuting Taya. Cage was defeated by Matanza Cueto for the Lucha Underground Championship. Cage defeated Texano in the best of seven series which he won a gauntlet.</p><p>On January 12, 2013, Cage and <a href=#>Michael Elgin</a> formed a team called the Unbreakable F'n Machines (a name derived from both wrestlers' nicknames) and participated in the 2013 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. In the opening round, they captured the PWG World Tag Team Championship by beating the previous year's winners, the Super Smash Bros. (Player Uno and Stupefied). The Unbreakable F'n Machines then lost the championship to The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) in the semifinal round of the tournament later that same day.</p><p>Cage has also competed in other various promotions such as Future Stars of Wrestling. Cage had a feud with <a href=#>Brandon Gatson</a> who would then compete against in a match on January 21, 2012 that was called the Match of the Year.</p><p>At Death to All But Metal on May 25, 2012, Cage (no longer using the "Taylor" moniker) received his first PWG World Championship title shot against champion Kevin Steen. At Threemendous III on July 21, Cage defeated Eddie Edwards before interfering in Kevin Steen's title defense against <a href=#>Willie Mack</a>, attacking both men. On September 1, on the first night of the 2012 Battle of Los Angeles, Cage defeated B-Boy to advance to the quarterfinal round before interfering in yet another Steen match, causing a non-title loss against Ricochet. The following day, Cage was eliminated from the tournament by <a href=#>Michael Elgin</a>, following interference from Steen. At Failure to Communicate on October 27, Cage defeated <a href=#>Willie Mack</a>, with whom he had been feuding since July.</p><p>Cage initially made an appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on August 30, 2012 competing in a tryout dark match against Robbie E in a losing effort. The following year, Cage made another appearance on the January 10, 2013 edition of Impact Wrestling in another tryout match but through the company's short lived TNA Gut Check program in a losing effort against <a href=#>Jay Bradley</a>. Cage would make another appearance in the year of 2014 during the summer at the June 26 Destination X taping special (aired the following month on July 31 in tape delay) in a triple threat match competing against Sanada and <a href=#>Crazzy Steve</a> to qualify in the next round for the vacant TNA X Division Championship, but in a losing effort.</p><p>Cage would then join the NWA Hollywood promotion where he would team up with <a href=#>Shaun Ricker</a> to form the tag team Natural Selection managed by Percy Pringle III. Towards the end of 2011, the team would split as Cage would feud with Ricker and would leave Cage as a single competitor.</p><p>Upon his release from WWE, Cage returned to the independent wrestling circuit and even competed in Asia. Cage would return to the Main Event Wrestling wrestling promotion where he would win the Main Event Wrestling California Cup where he beat <a href=#>Ryan Taylor</a>, <a href=#>Joey Ryan</a>, and finally T.J. Perkins. In October 2010, Cage wrestled and won a match against <a href=#>Kenny Dykstra</a> at Main Event Wrestling in internet pay-per-view.</p><p>Cage made his Pro Wrestling Guerrilla debut on July 30, 2010, against Brandon Bonham at Seven in a losing effort. In his next match, he lost once more to Bonham in the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles opening round. Soon after, Cage would form a stable with Chuck Taylor and <a href=#>Ryan Taylor</a> known as the Fightin' Taylor Boys, adding the last name to his own and becoming Brian Cage-Taylor. The group found occasional success (with Brian and Ryan doing most of the teaming), but were never challengers to the PWG World Tag Team Championship.</p><p>In June 2008, WWE signed Cage to a developmental contract, he reported to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling. When Cage first started with FCW he was using the name Brian Cage but was eventually asked to change it and came up with the name Kris Logan. The name Kris Logan was made to give homage to <a href=#>Chris Kanyon</a>, with the Logan part due to his similar appearance to the Marvel Comics character Wolverine, along with the outfit that he wore which sported yellow tights with claw marks. On July 23, 2009, Logan and <a href=#>Justin Gabriel</a> defeated The Dude Busters (Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta) to become FCW Florida Tag Team Champions. However, they lost the title that same night against The Rotundos (Bo Rotundo and Duke Rotundo). Later, Cage would then come up with a new character Night Claw. The Night Claw character was seen in a few matches and was supposed to be used during the time that Hurricane was still active in WWE. However, this did not occur as Cage was eventually released from his contract in September 2009.</p><p>Button was hired by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2008 and was assigned to their farm territory Florida Championship Wrestling, where he worked as Kris Logan. He left the promotion next year and began working in the American independent circuit, most notably Pro Wrestling Guerrilla as Brian Cage-Taylor. In 2014, Button was hired to appear in El Rey Network television series Lucha Underground, where he performed as Cage. Since Lucha Underground was created by Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, he appeared on several AAA show. Also, Cage appeared on AAA's American partner Impact Wrestling where he is a former Impact World Champion and a former Impact X Division Champion.</p><p>Cage's love of professional wrestling and desire to be a wrestler began with watching it on television as a kid. During those early year Cage became friends with the late <a href=#>Chris Kanyon</a> following a show that was held in Sacramento at Arco Arena where he made a sign that Kanyon noticed. Kanyon then became Cage's biggest advocate in his decision to pursue professional wrestling as a career. This eventually led to him and his friends starting their own Federation in 2004 called Main-Event Wrestling Federation (MWF) in Chico, CA. Cage's wrestling debut happened at an MWF show, against Kanyon. This eventually lead to a second show where Kanyon once again faced Cage. Cage ended up winning both matches against Kanyon. During this time, Cage had been training at Pro Championship Wrestling. Also, Cage competed at All Pro Wrestling. This continued until Cage, under Kanyon's advice, left to move to Atlanta to be in WWE's then developmental territory Deep South Wrestling.</p><p>Brian Christopher Button (born February 2, 1984), better known by the ring name Brian Cage, is an American professional wrestler and bodybuilder currently signed to All Elite Wrestling.</p><p>Brian Christopher Button was born on February 2, 1984 in Fresno, California.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfl7%2Bqrc1mmpqflQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&text=Brian%20Cage%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Brian%20Cage%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Brian%20Cage%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Brian%20Cage%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-cage-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&description=Brian%20Cage%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./craig-lowe-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Craig Lowe Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./arizona-robbins-had-a-prosthetic-leg-for-141-episodes-but-jessica-capshaw-only-wore-it-1-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arizona Robbins Had a Prosthetic Leg for 141 Episodes, but Jessica Capshaw Only Wore It 1 Time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
