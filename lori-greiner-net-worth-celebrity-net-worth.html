She grew up on the Near North Side of Chicago, the second daughter of a real estate developer and a psychologist. Her parents divorced when she was eight.&nbsp;She got her B.A. in communications with a focus on journalism from Loyola University Chicago. She worked for the Chicago Tribune while she was in college. She initially planned to be a playwright. She made and sold costume jewelry.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-237440 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Lori-Greiner.jpg alt width=440 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-237440 class=wp-caption-text>Neilson Barnard/Getty Images</p><h2 id=hsn-design-career><strong>HSN Design Career</strong></h2><p>In the mid-90s, Lori Greiner designed a plastic organizer to hold up to 100 pairs of earrings. Her earring organizer was picked up by J. C. Penney before the holiday season and was a huge hit. In her first six months in business, Greiner signed a deal to create products for JC Penney. Within a year, she was selling her products on cable TV; during her first appearance, she sold 2,500 earring organizers in just two minutes. Her earring organizer went on to make over $1 million within the year and sold out instantly when it debuted on the Home Shopping Network. The profits from her earring organizer allowed her to pay off the $300,000 loan she took out to produce it in 18 months. Within three years, Greiner's business had brought in more than $10 million in sales. By 2010, Greiner's For Your Ease Only brand racked up more than $350 million in sales.</p><p>Most of her products are organizers that range in price from $16 for a small anti-tarnish jewelry box to $299 for a spinning, mirrored jewelry cabinet. She makes 80% of her sales via QVC, the 24-hour cable channel. Since 2000, she has hosted a popular monthly show on QVC called "Clever and Unique Creations by Lori Greiner," which is&nbsp;one of the longest-running shows on the network.</p><p>She has developed over 700 products for men and women, offering shoppers solutions for organizing everything from their jewelry and makeup to their remote controls, the sweaters kept under their beds, and even cooking supplies. She holds more than 100 patents for her products in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>In 2011 she was the guest speaker at the first United States Patent and Trademark Office Women's Entrepreneurship Symposium.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294216 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lori-Greiner.jpg alt="Lori Greiner Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294216 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=shark-tank><strong>Shark Tank</strong></h2><p>Greiner's products are regularly featured in magazines like O The Oprah Magazine, InStyle, Woman's Day, and Family Circle.
