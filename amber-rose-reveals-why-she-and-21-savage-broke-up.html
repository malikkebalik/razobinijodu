She had been a popular hip hop model and he was a fast-rising rapper from Atlanta. The pair shared the kind of vibe that seemed like it could last forever. But as we know, that’s not how things panned out. Here’s why it didn’t work out, according to Amber Rose herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Amber-Rose-and-21-Savage.jpg><h2>A quick timeline of Amber Rose and 21 Savage’s relationship</h2><p id=par-2_43>Amber Rose and 21 Savage went public with their relationship in July 2017 after weeks of speculation. The announcement was met with pushback from fans who naturally questioned their relationship. But over time, lots of people grew to like them as a couple.</p><p id=par-3_60>21 Savage started opening up more and letting his softer side show while Amber Rose inherited a certain swagger and street credibility. They let their love shine at events such as the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and Amber Rose’s third SlutWalk in Los Angeles, where 21 Savage famously showed his support with a sign reading, “I’m a h*e too.”</p><p id=par-4_52>“It’s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,” Amber Rose captioned a now-deleted Instagram post of them (via <a href=#>People</a>). “I’m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to ‘pull up’ to defend my honor by any means.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-Savage-and-Amber-Rose.jpg><p id=par-5_63>Their relationship continued for about a year before reports emerged in March 2018 that Amber Rose and 21 Savage had called it quits. At the time, Amber Rose implied in an interview on <a href=#>Big Boy’s Neighborhood</a> that the “Bank Account” rapper had been the one to break things off, adding: “I really love him. I miss him. I think about him every day.”</p><h2>Amber Rose reveals exactly why she and 21 Savage broke up</h2><p id=par-6_43>Amber Rose said in an October appearance on <a href=#>Adam22’s No Jumper podcast</a> that things started to go downhill after the SlutWalk in October 2017. According to her, he had received a lot of backlash for his appearance and ultimately became affected by it.</p><p id=par-7_45>“Actually that’s what he wanted to do and I think that was ultimately the demise of our relationship. I think that he was being very supportive and he was like, ‘Man I should hold a sign that says, ‘I’m a h*e too!'” she explained.</p><p id=par-8_74>“I was like, ‘That would be really great for feminism! SlutWalk, you know you’re a rapper and Black men are always looked at to be&nbsp;very hyper-masculine&nbsp;and I think this would be a great moment.’ He was like, ‘Yo, I’m down!’ I got the sign made and everything and he held it up and then after that, I think the internet just went in on him too much and it just wasn’t good after that.”</p><p id=par-9_60>Going on, Amber Rose also suggested he had emotional barriers. “Obviously I seen a very soft side of him but I think that he’s scared to be loved. I think he has his own trauma, his own sh*t with him. But… I mean, I wouldn’t have been with him for a year if he was just not loving at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-Savage-and-Amber-Rose-1.jpg><h2>Amber Rose has since ceased all communication with 21 Savage</h2><p id=par-10_34>After their split, Amber Rose began dating music executive Alexander “AE” Edwards. They began dating in late 2018 and have since welcomed their first child, son Slash Electric, who was born in October 2019.</p><p id=par-11_52>When asked if she still speaks to her ex-boyfriend, Amber Rose replied, “I’m not friends with anyone. I don’t believe in that.” But she also implied there are no hard feelings towards 21 Savage, who said in an October interview on <a href=#>Big Facts</a> that he’s also “happily in love” with someone else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSurq7Eq2Srp6OaerOx1Z6YpatdrLW6edKhnGaZnpl6c32MrJivmZeaeqO%2BzqScZq2gY7W1ucto</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html&text=Amber%20Rose%20Reveals%20Why%20She%20and%2021%20Savage%20Broke%20Up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html&title=Amber%20Rose%20Reveals%20Why%20She%20and%2021%20Savage%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html&title=Amber%20Rose%20Reveals%20Why%20She%20and%2021%20Savage%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html&title=Amber%20Rose%20Reveals%20Why%20She%20and%2021%20Savage%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html&description=Amber%20Rose%20Reveals%20Why%20She%20and%2021%20Savage%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-squid-game-the-challenge-scripted.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Squid Game: The Challenge scripted?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adolfo-quinones-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adolfo Quinones Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
