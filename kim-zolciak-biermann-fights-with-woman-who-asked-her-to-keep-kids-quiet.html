Kim and husband Kroy Biermann slipped away for a little romantic rendezvous. While there, their four oldest children “surprised” them by arriving unexpectedly to join in the fun. I have to pause here because if I went away without my children, the point would likely be to be without my children. So if they showed up to surprise me on my dime, I’m not sure I would be as elated as Kim and Kroy were. But I digress because the point of this post is that Kim and crew were just enjoying themselves on the beach, being model tourists, when some horrible, wretched witch told them to shush! So Kim, with her usual diplomacy, basically told her to f–k off.</p><p>Kim Zolciak-Biermann‘s idyllic&nbsp;Turks and Caicos vacation&nbsp;with her&nbsp;husband Kroy Biermann&nbsp;turned into a family affair after four of their six kids joined them as a surprise.</p><p>The&nbsp;Don’t Be Tardy&nbsp;star took to Instagram and Snapchat to document the family fun on Sunday with kids&nbsp;Brielle, 19, Ariana, 15, KJ, 5, and Kash, 4&nbsp;— and a little oceanfront drama that unfolded.</p><p>“This lady on the beach came up to me and said: ‘Could you keep you and your kids quiet? It’s a very quiet peaceful beach,’ ” Zolciak-Biermann, 38, recounted on Snapchat. “Bitch, what? They’re 4 and 5.”</p><p>“We’ve been nothing but respectful,” she continued. “I told her: ‘Well, why are you always sitting next to me? Move your f—ing chair to the other end of the beach!’ ”</p><p>The argument appeared to escalate, as&nbsp;Zolciak-Biermann explained she told the fellow beachgoer they would be checking out of the hotel soon enough.</p><p>“I said: ‘That’s ok, bitch, because we’re leaving.’ She’s like: ‘I’m not asking you to leave.’ I honestly told her: ‘You might want to f—ing loosen up, lady,’ ” she continued. ” ‘This is a beach that a lot of people pay a lot of money to stay here and enjoy the beach and if you don’t like it, f—ing go somewhere else. It’s life.’ ”</p><p>“So KJ’s trying to be really quiet and respectful, but his feelings are hurt, which makes me really mad,” she said in another video of her son looking downcast on the beach — to which her&nbsp;eldest daughter, Brielle, shouted, “F— her!”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>So it’s Kim’s word against the lady’s. Either Kim’s kids were so raucous and unchecked that they were bothering the people around them or they were just being kids and the lady is overly sensitive. I am basing my opinion solely off what I have read here (and the fact that Kim’s version of the truth can be <a href=#>less</a> <a href=#>than</a> <a href=# title="Andy Cohen still can’t get Kim Zolciak to admit she’s had a nose job">truthful</a>) but I’m inclined to think the lady was probably on to something. If someone told me my kids were being too loud, my defense would be, ‘no they aren’t,’ not cite their age as justification for their actions. My favorite part is where Kim backs up her claim that they were being nothing but respectful by calling this woman a b—ch and telling her to, “Move your f—ing chair to the other end of the beach!” For me, it boils down to where they were staying. This was a romantic trip, right? So if the kids showing up was a surprise, it’s likely Kim and Kroy chose and intimate resort that probably was more kisses and champagne in the cabana as opposed to fart noises and water noodles to the noggin. In <a href=#>every</a> <a href=#>pic</a> <a href=#>Kim</a> posted there’s not a person in sight, let alone a kid. I am sorry KJ’s feeling got hurt because it isn’t his fault that someone other than his parents had to ask him to be quiet but my assumption is that maybe it was high time he heard it? Feel free to correct me in the comments if you watch their show and KJ is a saint. Also explain to me why these kids keep crashing their parents vacations, Brielle <a href=#>did the same</a> thing last May.</p><p>Oh, and Kim very much wants us to know that she and Kroy are going strong with this oh-so-subtle love note:</p><p><a href=#>So incredibly thankful for the MOST incredible man that has ever walked this planet. My rock, my best friend, my confidante, my lover, my strength, my Inspiration. You amaze me @kroybiermann 😍 you daily are a perfect example to our children of how selfless, nurturing, and generous a human should be. Your discipline, your structure, your determination is incredible to me. I love you so much and there isn't a second that goes by in a day that I don't look at you and smile and feel so loved, so respected, so cherished and so honored to be your wife. 😍 #ThankYouGod #APerfectExampleOfARealMan #BlessedAndIknowIt</a></p><p>A photo posted by Kim Zolciak-Biermann (@kimzolciakbiermann) on Jan 31, 2017 at 2:18pm PST</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/FFN_GRIM_Zolciak_Kim_050716_52047009.jpg alt=FFN_GRIM_Zolciak_Kim_050716_52047009 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/FFN_Bravo_Upfront_NYC_040313_51057295-649x1024.jpg alt=FFN_Bravo_Upfront_NYC_040313_51057295 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Instagram and Fame/Flynet Photos</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmpibX93e8qipJiyn6Gwqq3KZpminaKirq%2BrxaKeoayjlMSqwMeYrqilkaOsuLTOmJiso5WZrKmx0ZirqJebmrKxq8qim6yXoaq2psCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html&text=Kim%20Zolciak-Biermann%20fights%20with%20woman%20who%20asked%20her%20to%20keep%20kids%20quiet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html&title=Kim%20Zolciak-Biermann%20fights%20with%20woman%20who%20asked%20her%20to%20keep%20kids%20quiet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html&title=Kim%20Zolciak-Biermann%20fights%20with%20woman%20who%20asked%20her%20to%20keep%20kids%20quiet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html&title=Kim%20Zolciak-Biermann%20fights%20with%20woman%20who%20asked%20her%20to%20keep%20kids%20quiet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-zolciak-biermann-fights-with-woman-who-asked-her-to-keep-kids-quiet.html&description=Kim%20Zolciak-Biermann%20fights%20with%20woman%20who%20asked%20her%20to%20keep%20kids%20quiet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiger-woods-net-worth-houses-endorsements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiger Woods Net Worth: Houses &amp;amp; Endorsements">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jared-leto-is-pretty-healthy-but-enjoys-the-occasional-vegan-treat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jared Leto Is 'Pretty Healthy,' but Enjoys the Occasional Vegan Treat">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
