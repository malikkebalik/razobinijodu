The youngest of five kids, <a href=#>the Eternals actor </a>recalls how being in a house full of adults fueled his creativity.</p><p id=par-4_49>“Acting really started for me because I was in a house full of adults,” Henry said to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview Magazine</a>. “They had to go to work, my sisters were starting their families, so I had to find a way to entertain myself, really, and that’s when I got into acting.”</p><p id=par-5_14>Like Henry, he credits his mother as also being creative in her own right.</p><p id=par-6_42>“She was incredibly creative,” Henry said about his mother, who was an educator. “I used to love going to her school during the summer and helping her decorate her classroom. I would draw Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck. She was a sixth-grade teacher.”</p><p id=par-7_24>Although he was born in Fateveille, North Carolina, Henry later moved to Washington D.C.

As much as the actor appreciated his newfound success in Atlana, which eventually earned him an Emmy nomination, Henry asserts that his victory felt a bit hollow without his mother present.</p><p id=par-12_51>“What kills me is everyone’s like, ‘How do you feel about <a href=#>this Emmy nomination</a>?’” Henry said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>. “My mother’s dead. Every time I close my eyes, I see my hand on her casket. Every time I close my eyes, I hear my necklace bang on her casket.”</p><p id=par-13_21>Henry found some level of comfort in his acting, but without his mother around, he wasn’t able to enjoy his accomplishments.</p><p id=par-14_30>“So being busy helps, but y’all don’t understand.

In the beginning of the episode, it hints that it’s the anniversary of Alfred’s mother’s death. Henry, who plays Alfred on the show, couldn’t help but to feel a connection to its set up. However, the episode wasn’t</p><p id=par-16_7>written with Henry’s late mother in mind.</p><p id=par-17_32>Hiro Murai, one of Atlanta’s directors, saw the episode as an experiment. “And part of that was knowing that we were touching on something that was really real,” he said to GQ.</p><p id=par-18_17>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Guide</a>, Henry credits the episode for helping him get through his loss.</p><p id=par-19_46>“It was very instrumental in my healing,” Henry said about the episode. “Alfred is in this place, in the woods…he can’t understand how his environment shifted.
