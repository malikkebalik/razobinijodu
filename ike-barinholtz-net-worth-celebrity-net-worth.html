He added, "Sometimes it takes getting hurt to realize how lucky you are to have great people in your life. My family has been taking amazing care of me, and Mindy and all the folks at the show have been so kind. Also, many friends have sent lots of food which is great — but I can't exercise, so in a way, it's exceptionally cruel."</p><h2 id=award-nominations><strong>Award Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 2013, Barinholtz earned a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for New Series for "The Mindy Project," and in 2017, he shared a BAM Award nomination for Best Cast with his "The Disaster Artist" co-stars.
