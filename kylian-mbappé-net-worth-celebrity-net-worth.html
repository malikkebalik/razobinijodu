Kylian Mbappé is one of the highest-paid soccer players on the planet. When he was just 19 years old, Kylian earned nearly $25 million between salary and endorsements. Today he earns a base salary of $53 million PLUS $10 million for endorsements every year, for a total of $63 million in pre-tax earnings.</p><p>Widely regarded as one of the top players in the world, he has won multiple Ligue 1 and Coupe de France titles. Meanwhile, as part of the French national team, Mbappé helped his country win the FIFA World Cup in 2018.</p><p>Kylian is the youngest French player to score a goal in a World Cup and the second-youngest player overall to score a goal in a World Cup final (at the 2018 games). Kylian famously donated his entire $500,000 World Cup bonus to a charity that supports disabled children.</p><h2 id=psg-contracts><strong>PSG Contracts</strong></h2><p>In June 2022, after months of speculation that he was considering offers from other teams, Kylian re-signed with Paris Saint-Germain. The extension was worth $160 million over three years, paying around $53 million in base salary per year. The deal also came with a $106 million signing bonus, <a href=#>for a total contract value of $266.5 million</a>.</p><p>In July 2023, it was reported that Paris Saint-Germain offered Mbappé a 10-year contract worth $1.1 billion.</p><h2 id=772-million-saudi-contract><strong>$772 Million Saudi Contract</strong></h2><p>In July 2023 it was also reported that Saudi team Al-Hilal offered a world-record $330 million transfer fee to PSG for Kylian. If he accepts the deal, Kylian's salary at Al-Hilal would be a staggering $772 million PER YEAR. The annual value breaks down as the following:</p><ul><li>$64 million per month</li><li>$2 million per day</li><li>$90,000 per hour</li><li>$1,400 per minute</li><li>$25 per second</li></ul><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kylian Mbappé was born on December 20, 1998 in Paris, France to football coach Wilfried, a Cameroon native, and former handball player Fayza, who is of Algerian Kabyle origin. He has a younger brother named Ethan who also plays football. As a youth, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in the Parisian commune of Bondy.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Mbappé kicked off his football playing career at AS Bondy, where he was coached by his father. He eventually moved on to the Clairefontaine academy, and proved his prowess through a number of impressive performances that drew the attention of the major clubs. At the age of 11, Mbappé was invited to train with Real Madrid's under-12s. A few years later, he went to London to play in a match with Chelsea's youth team.</p><h2 id=monaco><strong>Monaco</strong></h2><p>After considering various professional clubs, Mbappé finally settled on Monaco. Promoted from the B-team after just three weeks, he made his first-team debut in December of 2015 in a 1-1 Ligue 1 draw against Caen. In February of the next year, Mbappé made his first goal for Monaco's first team in a Ligue 1 3-1 win over Troyes. In the process, he became the youngest first-team goal-scorer in the history of Monaco.</p><p>Mbappé had resounding success over his next two years with Monaco. In December of 2016, he scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career in a 7-0 win over Rennes. Early the next year, he scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in a 5-0 rout of Metz. Mbappé finished the 2016-17 season with an incredible 26 goals across 44 matches, leading to Monaco's clinching of the Ligue 1 title. Moreover, he was named Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year.</p><h2 id=paris-saint-germain><strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Mbappé signed with Monaco league rivals Paris Saint-Germain. He scored in his debut in a 5-1 Ligue 1 win over Metz. Mbappé went on to win his first league title with the club, as well as the 2017-18 Coupe de France. He continued his amazing success the next season, winning the inaugural Kopa Trophy as the best player in the world under 21. In early 2019, Mbappé scored a hat-trick in a 9-0 rout of Guingamp, and scored another one a couple months later in a 3-1 win against his former club Monaco. Once again, Paris Saint-Germain finished the season as the Ligue 1 champion, and Mbappé earned his second Ligue 1 Player of the Year Award.</p><p>After the season was called off due to the COVID pandemic in May of 2020, Paris Saint-Germain was again crowned the Ligue 1 champion due to having been in first place. When the season resumed, the team continued its success. Notably, Mbappé scored his 40th goal of the season in a 4-0 win over Reims, marking his most prolific season to date. Just three days after this, he helped Paris Saint-Germain win the Coupe de France title. Mbappé once again finished the season as the Ligue 1 Player of the Year. He only continued to demonstrate his dominance the following season, when he reached 100 league goals for Paris Saint-Germain. At just shy of 23 years of age, Mbappé became the youngest player ever to score that many goals for a single team in Ligue 1. In 2023, he became the first PSG player to score five goals in a match in their 7-0 victory over Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France round of 32.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-265377 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kylian-Mbappé.jpg alt="Kylian Mbappé Net Worth and Salary" width=594 height=390 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-265377 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=international-play><strong>International Play</strong></h2><p>Mbappé has been just as successful in international play as he has with Ligue 1. In 2016, he scored five times for the French national team to win the UEFA European Under-19 Championship. His greatest achievement came two years later, when he was called up to the France squad for the FIFA World Cup. In his first game, he scored the winning goal against Peru in the Group C matchup. Later, Mbappé scored twice in a 4-3 win over Argentina, making him only the second teenager after Pelé to score twice in a World Cup match. Finally, in the World Cup Final against Croatia, Mbappé scored in the 4-2 win against Croatia, giving France its second title in World Cup history. With France, Mbappé has also played in UEFA Euro 2020 and the 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals.</p><p>Mbappé has a business partnership with Nike; the brand has released personalized football boots in his name, including the Nike Hypervenom 3 and the Nike Mercuria Superfly VI.</p><p>Mbappé has featured prominently in EA Sports' "FIFA" video game series, beginning with "FIFA 18." Notably, he was the cover star of both "FIFA 21" and "FIFA 22"; for the former, he became the youngest player ever to appear on the cover of the game solo.</p><h2 id=philanthropic-endeavors><strong>Philanthropic Endeavors</strong></h2><p>In his philanthropic work, Mbappé donated $34,000 to a crowdfunding campaign to finance a private mission to find missing footballer Emiliano Sala, whose aircraft went missing over the English Channel. He later donated another $34,000 to fund the search of the plane's missing pilot, David Ibbotson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWjpLCksdFoorKkmZa7brnBmqepnV2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Kylian%20Mbapp%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kylian%20Mbapp%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kylian%20Mbapp%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kylian%20Mbapp%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkylian-mbapp%25C3%25A9-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Kylian%20Mbapp%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stephen-lynch-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephen Lynch Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jimmy-fallon-holds-back-tears-as-he-pays-tribute-to-late-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jimmy Fallon holds back tears as he pays tribute to late mother">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
