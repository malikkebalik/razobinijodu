Their father passed away years ago and so they talk to him now through tea leaves and mediums. They turned to their dad whenever they feel adrift. They got a message from him the last time that said they should open their own restaurant. They believed that going into business for themselves would finally give them what they’ve always been seeking. But they had been wrong about that. They went to work in a restaurant and they hated how much they were changing there. They were starting to feel like two separate people. And they hated that because they wanted to be treated like the same person.</p><p>It was something started by their father. Their father could never tell them apart when they were kids and so he used to treat them like the same person by giving them the same nickname. Only daddy dearest now regrets that according to the Medium. Their dad now blames himself for not teaching them that they could be loved on their own. They didn’t have to be exactly like their sister to be loved. They didn’t have to do everything together. They didn’t have to share the same boyfriend. He wanted them to each find people on their own. He also wanted them to have children and not be afraid that they might come out different.</p><p>The twins wanted to have a baby and be pregnant at the same time. But their dad was telling them one baby could be a girl and the other could be a boy. It was time to brace their differences because they couldn’t keep going through life as the same. He was truly sorry about the way he used to treat them because they deserved better. The medium said all of this to them and they were hurt at first. They didn’t like hearing that their father was disappointed in them because they never sought their own unique identity. And they had no idea where to go from here.</p><p>Over with Christina and Jessica, Christina was giving birth. She chose to have a home birth. She wanted to have her baby in a blow up pool and her sole focus was on her baby. Her sister’s focus was how to tell Christina’s husband that he wasn’t wanted. Jessica said that she could handle her sister. She’s the only one that could give her comfort and that John would just get in the way of that. She wondered why he had to be in the room at all. Only this was John’s baby. John was feeling so emotional about becoming a new dad that he didn’t want to be anywhere else.</p><p>Jessica could do things he couldn’t. Take for instance when she cleaned the poop out of the pool. Jessica was used to seeing her sister poop and last time Christina had been pregnant she had been constipated. It was Jessica who had to reach up there to get the poop. It doesn’t faze her at all while John often felt he had no clue what to do. He just wants to comfort her. He also wanted Jessica to get out of the way and so the baby saved them from fighting. It was pretty hard to fight with a newborn in the room. Especially one so calm as their son/nephew.</p><p>The new baby forced Christina’s family to prioritize the baby. Only there won’t be a baby for Ashley and Vee. Vee was supposed to act as Ashley’s surrogate because Ashley couldn’t have any more children on her own. They told family about it. They told friends. They even got ostracized by certain family members when they told others their news and now its not happening. It got shut down after they argued over the phone. Ashley said a few things she regrets. Vee was the same in talking before thinking. And so they met up for lunch a few days later to discuss it.</p><p>They didn’t want to go over what was said. They just wanted to instantly forgive each other and that’s what was happening until Vee said she couldn’t carry Ashley’s baby anymore. She forgives her sister for what she said, but she can’t forget that she was pushing her body to give Ashley the chance of another baby and Ashley threw in her face that she can always get a dog. Vee felt a child shouldn’t be compared to a dog. She also felt that Ashley was saying that because she truly believes it and so that’s why she decided to not be Ashley’s surrogate anymore.</p><p>Vee explained her actions to Ashley as best as she could. She just couldn’t stop Ashley from getting upset with her. Ashley felt Vee was blowing her comment out of proportions. It made her question if Vee really did want to be a surrogate to begin with or if she was always going to drop out before anything happened. Ashley could forgive her sister for what she said on the phone call. She just couldn’t get passed Vee failing to be her surrogate. They were supposed to do this together. Now, they aren’t and so what’s left for them.</p><p>Anna and Lucy were feeling the same way. They had lunch with their shared man and their mother. They told them what the medium said their father was telling them. They also express sadness with the whole encounter. They didn’t want to be different. They wanted to be the same because that’s what they thought their father wanted. And now with their dad telling them to get their own lives, they started trying to do things on their own and they began with eating.</p><p>Randi meanwhile informed her twin that she and her husband were moving out. The twins once had a dream of always living together and, while that was nice as kids, they weren’t kids anymore. They have their own lives. Randi also needed to prioritize her own marriage. And so she has to move out.</p><p>Though funnily enough, John and Jessica eventually came around to respecting each other. They both love Christina and they could bond over that.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnla3Bs7HMnmSsoaOpsrO%2FjJ%2Bgp5mcmnqzscKap2ZoY2J%2FeHmRbGSsnZGovK95kWacqaGjpLGmeZBpZKKso2K7sMCMqK2eql8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html&text=Extreme%20Sisters%20Finale%20Recap%2003%2f27%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Its%20Not%20Over&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html&title=Extreme%20Sisters%20Finale%20Recap%2003%2f27%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Its%20Not%20Over" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html&title=Extreme%20Sisters%20Finale%20Recap%2003%2f27%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Its%20Not%20Over" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html&title=Extreme%20Sisters%20Finale%20Recap%2003%2f27%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Its%20Not%20Over" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fextreme-sisters-finale-recap-03-27-23-season-2-episode-10-it-s-not-over.html&description=Extreme%20Sisters%20Finale%20Recap%2003%2f27%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Its%20Not%20Over" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./for-reasons-better-left-unexplained-a-40-year-old-skin-flick-makes-bedroom-eyes-at-the-streaming-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="For reasons better left unexplained, a 40 year-old skin flick makes bedroom eyes at the streaming To">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./domhnall-gleeson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Domhnall Gleeson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
