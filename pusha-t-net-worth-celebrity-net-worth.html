He is also known as one half of the hip-hop duo Clipse, alongside his brother and fellow rapper Gene "No Malice" Thornton. In the early '90s, the brothers formed a relationship with the Neptunes' <a href=# title="Pharrell Williams Net Worth">Pharrell Williams</a> and embarked on a career that would include major-label record deals and critically acclaimed albums.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Terrence LeVarr Thornton (better known as Pusha T) was born May 13, 1977 in The Bronx, New York City, New York. The family soon relocated to Virginia Beach, Virginia and that's where Thornton and his brother Gene grew up. Both brothers, as teens, sold drugs and Gene eventually ended up being kicked out of their parents' house after they found out what he was doing. It was in 1992 that he and Gene began to pursue a career in hip hop and they formed a group known as Clipse.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After the brothers formed Clipse, they were introduced to record producer and fellow Virginian Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes. Williams helped them secure a recording contract with Elektra Records in 1997. They began working on their debut album "Exclusive Audio Footage," however, the first single that dropped, "The Funeral," was a commercial bust and the release of the album was canceled. Clipse was dropped from the label soon after and Terrence took on the moniker Pusha T. Despite not being with a major label, Pusha T made numerous appearances during this time on other artists' songs, including Kelis and Nivea.</p><p>In early 2001, the duo was signed by Pharrell Williams to Arista Records. Clipse began working on their major label debut, executively produced by The Neptunes. Their debut single, "Grindin," was released on May 14, 2002. The song became a summer Top 40 hit and reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July of that same year. They enjoyed similar success with their second single "When the Last Time," which peaked at No. 19. Clipse released their debut album "Lord Willin" in August 2002 and it debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip hop Album chart and No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The album was eventually certified gold by the RIAA in October 2002. Clipse began recording material for their second album "Hell Hath no Fury" in late 2003. However, work on the album ground to a halt in 2004 when Arista Records's hip hop artists were absorbed into its sister label Jive Records as part of a merger between Sony Music Entertainment and BMG. Clipse was forced to stay on Jive due to contractual requirements. Clipse resumed work on the album and finished it but the brothers became increasingly frustrated with the Jive label.</p><p>In 2004, Pusha T and his brother launched their own record label imprint, Re-Up Records and formed hip-hop group Re-Up Gang, along with fellow rappers Ab-Liva and Sandman. In 2006, the group finally released their third studio album (and most commercial), "Hell Hath No Fury," which was praised by critics. The album, once again produced by The Neptunes, debuted at No. 14 on the Billboard chart. It spawned the moderately successful singles "Mr. Me Too" and "Wamp Wamp (What It Do).&nbsp; After Clipse released their fourth album,"Til the Casket Drops," in December 2009, both No Malice and Pusha T announced they were taking time off from the duo to focus on their own respective solo projects.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314848 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Pusha-T-1.jpg alt width=900 height=743 sizes="(max-width: 1565px) 100vw, 1565px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314848 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)</p><p>In 2010, Pusha T announced he was signing with <a href=# title="Kanye West Net Worth">Kanye West</a>'s G.O.O.D. Music label and on March 21, 2011, released his first solo project, a mixtape titled "Fear of God," which was well-received by critics, followed by its official sequel, Fear of God II: Let Us Pray, also via G.O.O.D. In 2011, Pusha T appeared on season two of HBO's "How to Make it in America." Later that year, he appeared on English pop singer <a href=# title="Pixie Lott Net Worth">Pixie Lott</a>'s song "What Do You Take Me For?". The song was a hit single in the UK and peaked at No. 10 on the UK Top 40. The label released Pusha T's official debut album, "My Name Is My Name" in 2013 with guest appearances from <a href=# title="Rick Ross Net Worth">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=# title="2 Chainz Net Worth">2 Chainz</a>, <a href=# title="Kendrick Lamar Net Worth">Kendrick Lamar</a> and others. In December 2015, Pusha released the album "King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude." In 2018 Pusha released the album "Daytona" to wide critical acclaim.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Pusha T has been nominated for three Grammy awards. First for Best Rap/Sung "Like I Love You" as part of Clipse and with <a href=# title="Justin Timberlake Net Worth">Justin Timberlake</a>. Next, he was nominated in 2013 for Best Rap Performance for "Mercy" with Kanye West, <a href=# title="Big Sean Net Worth">Big Sean</a>, and 2 Chainz. He was also nominated in 2019 for Best Rap Album for "Daytona."</p><p>Pusha T has been involved in several feuds over the years, first with former label-mate Consequence over the single "My God," the first single from Pusha's solo mixtape. Consequence took to Twitter to claim that Pusha T stole his flow and lyrics from a song of his that Pusha was supposed to appear on, "The Last Supper." Tension between Pusha T and the rapper <a href=# title="Lil Wayne Net Worth">Lil Wayne</a> went on for years, beginning after Clipse and <a href=# title="Birdman Net Worth">Birdman</a> had worked on "What Happened to That Boy." Lil Wayne suspected that Clipse's song "Mr. Me Too" was directed at him. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne claiming publicly that he is over it. Pusha T was also famously involved in a feud with <a href=# title="Drake Net Worth">Drake</a> after the release of T's song "Exodus 23:1." Their feud was further escalated with the song "Infrared" from his 2018 hit album "Daytona," where he accused Drake of using a ghostwriter for his lyrics. Drake responded to the song less than 24 hours later with the diss track "Duppy Freestyle."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Pusha T and his wife Virginia Williams welcomed Nigel Brixx Thronton in June 2020. The child's middle name attracted controversy for "Brixx" being a slang term for cocaine, a substance Pusha T frequently raps about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6XCtLTAZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Pusha%20T%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pusha%20T%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pusha%20T%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pusha%20T%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpusha-t-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Pusha%20T%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ted-shanks-conservation-area-hunting-accident-18.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ted Shanks Conservation Area Hunting Accident: 18">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fired-vanderpump-rules-stars-want-to-move-forward-from-incident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fired 'Vanderpump Rules' Stars Want to 'Move Forward' From Incident">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
