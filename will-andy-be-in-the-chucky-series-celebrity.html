He’s set to be joined by other such familiar faces as Jennifer Tilly’s Tiffany Valentine, Fiona Dourif’s Chucky-possessed Nica Pierce, and Christine Elise McCarthy as Andy’s foster sister Kyle.</p><p>Chucky ‘s cast will consist of many longstanding members of the franchise as well as some newcomers.<strong> Alex Vincent returns as Andy</strong>, the original child tormented by the killer puppet in the first Child’s Play movie, and Christine Elise will also reprise her role as Andy’s foster sister Kyle.</p><p>Following the news that the “Chucky” TV show is bringing back Jennifer Tilly (as Tiffany),<strong> Alex Vincent</strong> (Andy), Christine Elise (Kyle), and Fiona Dourif (Nica), Mancini spoke further about why he decided to include everyone’s favorite characters in the new series. Chucky is about family Syfy/USA Network</p><p>Chucky (TV series) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Chucky is an upcoming American horror television series created by Don Mancini based on the eponymous character from the Child’s Play franchise. It is set to premiere on Syfy and the USA Network on October 12, 2021.</p><p>Andy was chased by Chucky in the first two movies of the franchise, and the adult version of the character would come back for a post-credits scene of Curse of Chucky, the sixth film of the franchise, that went straight to video after the box office failure of the fifth installment, Seed of Chucky.</p><p>Chucky Teaser Arrives, Franchise Stars Alex Vincent & Christine Elise McCarthy Return 06 April 2021 | MovieWeb Chucky TV series brings back Andy and Kyle, new promo released</p><p>However, Jake is not the first person to have encountered Chucky, and the series premiere alludes to Chucky’s first “owner,” Andy Barclay. Andy first appeared in the first 1988 Child’s Play and went on to face off with Chucky in several sequels. What’s Andy up to now? Let’s review.</p><h2>Where is Andy during the events of the Chucky series?</h2><p>Where is Andy during the events of the Chucky series? Andy is presumably<strong> still on his anti-Chucky crusade,</strong> and he calls Jake to warn him about Good Guy dolls. We know that Vincent will appear in the series, so it probably bodes well for Jake that he’ll have a seasoned doll-killer in his corner. Now, if only Andy were able to kill Chucky and make it stick…</p><p>In Chucky, the new USA Network and SYFY series, the serial-killer possessed doll has found a new “owner,” a teen named<strong> Jake Webber</strong> (Zackary Arthur). However, Jake is not the first person to have encountered Chucky, and the series premiere alludes to Chucky’s first “owner,” Andy Barclay. Andy first appeared in the first 1988 Child’s Play and went on to face off with Chucky in several sequels. What’s Andy up to now? Let’s review.</p><p>Andy (played by Alex Vincent in most of the films and in the series) made his debut as a<strong> 6-year-old</strong> in Child’s Play, when he’s gifted a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unfortunately, as is so often the case, that Good Guy doll has been possessed by the spirit of a serial killer, the notorious Charles Lee Ray. After gruesomely murdering several people in Andy’s life, Chucky attempts to transfer his soul into Andy so that he can be a real boy. However, Andy, his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks), and detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) are able to defeat the doll.</p><h2>What is the backstory of Chucky?</h2><p>More of Charles Lee Ray is seen in Curse of Chucky when the film tells<strong> the story of a woman named Sarah.</strong></p><p>The film was a hit with horror buffs and quickly launched a franchise that has spawned a total of<strong> six</strong> sequels and a reboot. While the Child’s Play movie this year had no connection to previous films, Child’s Play creator Don Mancini is still planning to continue the original Chucky storyline in the form of a TV show.</p><p><strong>Nica Pierce</strong> is a paraplegic character who was first introduced in the film Curse of Chucky. Nica is framed for the murder of her family and is sent to a mental institute at the end of the film. Cult of Chucky continues this storyline, showing Nica facing the truths of her “crimes”. By the end of the film, Chucky has possessed Nica and used her to kill Dr. Foley and escape the hospital.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Seed of Chucky</strong> is often credited as the worst film in the Child’s Play franchise. The film introduces Chucky and Tiffany’s son/daughter named Glen/Glenda who is responsible for resurrecting his parents. Glen/Glenda was unlike his parents and didn’t enjoy killing people.</p><p>When Andy leaves his cabin to find Nica, he sends Kyle to his home<strong> to continue to torture Chucky’s head.</strong> Kyle and Andy will likely team up in the TV series, but it would be interesting to see them save Nica and team up with her as well.</p><p><strong>Not a lot is known about the series, except that it will</strong> air<strong> on</strong> Sy<strong>fy next year and</strong> be a continuation of the Cult<strong> of Chucky</strong> storyline. Horror buffs are eagerly awaiting the return of Chucky, so here are 5 Things We Want To See In The Chucky TV Show (And 5 Things We Don’t).</p><p>While<strong> continuing the Child’s Play franchise as a TV show may seem like an interesting idea,</strong> it could also be a cause for concern. Don Mancini has had a lot of freedom with his Chucky movies, but there is only so much that can be shown on cable television.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoqScYq6vsNhmmZ5lmaN6tbTEZpqhrZOgxm6%2FxKugnqtdboN4fpNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html&text=Will%20Andy%20Be%20In%20The%20Chucky%20Series%3f%20%20Celebrity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html&title=Will%20Andy%20Be%20In%20The%20Chucky%20Series%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html&title=Will%20Andy%20Be%20In%20The%20Chucky%20Series%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html&title=Will%20Andy%20Be%20In%20The%20Chucky%20Series%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-andy-be-in-the-chucky-series-celebrity.html&description=Will%20Andy%20Be%20In%20The%20Chucky%20Series%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wordle-707-hints-may-27-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wordle #707 Hints - May 27 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tosh-townend-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tosh Townend Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
