Contestants won’t make it far if they don’t have solid survival skills. If you can’t fish, forage, or make a fire, you <a href=#>won’t last long in the wilderness</a>. But practical knowledge is just one part of the game. Participants who can’t handle the isolation often crumble under the pressure of being alone with their own thoughts, as happens in season 11’s third episode, which aired June 27.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_11><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers for </strong><strong>Alone </strong><strong>Season 11 Episode 3.]&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-alone-season-11-cast-settles-into-a-rhythm>The ‘Alone’ Season 11 cast settles into a rhythm&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alone-Season-11-History-Channel.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-3_47>With the first few days – and the initial shock of being completely isolated from other people – behind them, the <a href=#>Alone Season 11 cast</a> is settling into a new rhythm in episode 3. For most, that means setting up a more permanent shelter and finding food.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_60>Several of the survivalists featured in this episode have not eaten since they arrived at camp. They have to balance a desire to build a home that will keep them warm through the winter (which can take a substantial amount of energy) and tracking down precious calories. Miscalculating in this area has taken out multiple Alone contestants in the past.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_98>“The plan for all this is attempting to make the warmest shelter that this show’s seen,” Isaiah says. His vision? Build the frame of a log shelter and then gradually add insulation to the inside, so that he can make it warmer as the days grow colder. He thinks that if he can pull it off, the result will rival Roland Welker’s famous rock house from season 7. It’s a tough job, but not as hard as some of the personal challenges he’s faced, including the devastating death of his brother, who was killed by a distracted driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_56>Dub is satisfied with his shelter, so he turns his focus to fishing and hunting. His first attempts are unsuccessful, but eventually, he catches a massive pike. Unlike fellow contestant Peter, he’s not going to try to preserve food, which he thinks usually ends in wasted calories. He’s going to eat what he catches right away.</p><p id=par-7_17>“I think the best place for my food to be safe is in my body,” he says.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-plant-misidentification-threatens-to-sideline-michela>A plant misidentification threatens to sideline Michela&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_44>Dusty, who is from Arkansas, might not be used to the Arctic climate. But so far, he seems to be thriving in his new environment. He’s built a table to store his tools and kills some squirrels, which gives him a boost of confidence.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_12>“I’ve come to realize that I’m right where I belong,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_34>William, a commercial fisherman from Labrador, is also thriving so far in his Alone journey. Unsurprisingly, he’s already had success fishing, and in this episode, he catches a rabbit in one of his snares.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_49>At her camp, Michela uses some horsetail ferns as camouflage while duck hunting. Unfortunately, neither her disguise nor her duck decoys are much help when it comes to killing birds. Her fishing net is also empty, and she’s starting to get “a little concerned” about her lack of protein.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_67>Michela’s mood brightens when she discovers a plant with edible, carb-rich roots. But what she thinks is burdock is actually arctic dock, which is edible but can have laxative properties. Her meal of roots and berries leaves her throwing up blood in a graphic scene. At that point, she’s already caught a fish, but it’s a reminder that a simple misstep can have serious consequences on Alone.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-one-cast-member-decides-it-s-time-to-go-home>One cast member decides it’s time to go home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ALONES11_Peter-Albano.jpg><p id=par-13_20>Finally, there’s Peter. He’s eaten nothing but berries since arriving five days ago, but he’s trying not to get discouraged.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_46>“I just need one success,” as he prepares a fishing lure. Soon, his efforts pay off, and he catches a pike. The next day, he catches multiple fish in his net, and he promptly builds a smoker in an effort to preserve some of the meat.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_52>But even though Peter seems to be on a roll, he admits to struggling mentally. He opens up about his tendency to bottle up his emotions and his difficultly seeing his son express his feelings. He confesses to wanting his son to “bury” his feelings as a way to avoid getting hurt.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_29>“My son, he feels big feelings. And I’ve never been able to relate or empathize with him,” he says. “I feel terrible. I feel this overwhelming sense of failure.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_53>Peter realizes that the walls he put up to manage his emotions are not working. He’s feeling overwhelmed by “sadness and grief” and it’s too much for him. It’s hard not to feel that what he needs is therapy, not an appearance on a reality TV show. After eight days, Peter taps out.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_34>“I was absolutely not ready or expecting this,” he says. “I’m concerned it’s going to keep getting worse … I need to fix my relationship with [my family] … It’s time to go home.”</p><p id=par-19_12>Alone Season 11 airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on History Channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-20_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSurbvNnmSsnZGovK95kGpknqiZqLylsYxsZKudk5a9brzAq6uim5mlrq%2FAjJ%2BYnJ2jYsGwwcahnKysXZi1orjLnqWgnV2usrV6x62kpWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html&text=One%20Participant%20Faces%20His%20Toughest%20Challenge%20Yet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html&title=One%20Participant%20Faces%20His%20Toughest%20Challenge%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html&title=One%20Participant%20Faces%20His%20Toughest%20Challenge%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html&title=One%20Participant%20Faces%20His%20Toughest%20Challenge%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-participant-faces-his-toughest-challenge-yet.html&description=One%20Participant%20Faces%20His%20Toughest%20Challenge%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paris-hilton-married-carter-reum-in-a-lavish-wedding-we-re-sure-to-hear-more-about.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paris Hilton married Carter Reum in a lavish wedding were sure to hear more about">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lin-manuel-miranda-brother-javier-miranda-sister-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lin Manuel Miranda Brother Javier Miranda Sister: Siblings">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
