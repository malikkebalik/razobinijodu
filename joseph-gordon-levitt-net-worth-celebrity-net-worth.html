Joseph Gordon-Levitt began his acting career starring in many commercials before landing significant roles in television, most notably in NBC's hit sitcom, "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996-2001). Transitioning to film, he gained critical praise for his roles in independent movies like "Mysterious Skin" (2004) and "Brick" (2005). His breakthrough in mainstream cinema came with "(500) Days of Summer" (2009), earning him a Golden Globe nomination. Further success followed with pivotal roles in high-profile films including "Inception" (2010), "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012), and "Looper" (2012). Gordon-Levitt made his directorial debut with "Don Jon" (2013), in which he also starred. He is also the founder of HitRecord, an online collaborative production company.</p><h2 id=early-years><strong>Early Years</strong></h2><p>Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt was born on February 17th of 1981 in Los Angeles, California. He was raised in a Jewish family by a father who was involved with news broadcasting and a mother who was a politician. Hollywood runs in the family, as his maternal grandfather was a major Hollywood director who directed 1950's Cyrano de Bergerac. JGL had one older brother who passed away in 2010. In 1999, Joseph Gordon-Levitt graduated from high school.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt began his acting career at a very early age. As young as four, JGL was acting in local theater productions. During one of these theater productions, Joseph was spotted by an agent who signed him as a child actor. JGL subsequently started appearing in a range of commercials at a young age. Some of his earliest bookings were in commercials for Sunny Jim peanut butter, Cocoa Puffs, Pop-Tarts, Kinney Shoes.</p><p>By the age of six, JGL was appearing in made-for-TV movies. At age ten, JGL had graduated to roles in television series such as Dark Shadows. Later, he landed his first big movie role in A River Runs Through It. JGL followed up with roles in TV series like The Powers that Be and leading roles in movies like Switching Parents and Angels in the Outfield.</p><p>One of JGL's most notable roles as a child actor came in 1996 when he landed a lead role in the hit sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun. Gordon-Levitt played an alien who was masquerading as a human, and the sci-fi comedy ran for six seasons. In 1998, he appeared in an episode of That 70s Show in a guest role. During the 90s, Joseph Gordon-Levitt also appeared in a range of movies, including 10 Things I Hate About You and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.</p><p>He also proved his abilities as a voice actor with Disney's Treasure Planet. JGL voiced the lead character in the film, which was the most expensive traditionally-animated movie of all time. Treasure Planet had a budget of $140 million, and despite mostly positive reviews, the movie failed to perform very well at the box office.</p><p>Following this success, Joseph attended college and focused more on his education rather than acting. By 2004, he had dropped out, choosing to pursue acting full-time once again. When he returned, JGL decided that he wanted to be more selective in the movies he chose. He started to appear in artsier, independent films such as Manic, Mysterious Skin, and Brick. Other films during this period included Latter Days, Havoc, and Shadowboxer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-301989 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Joseph-Gordon-Levitt-1.jpg alt width=900 height=602 sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-301989 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M.
